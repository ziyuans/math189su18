Start file for hw1pr2 of Big Data Summer 2018

Before attemping the problem, please familiarize with pandas and numpy
libraries. Tutorials can be found online:
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html

This file only has one part: the main driver.

First, fill in the solution you obtained from part (a) in part (c) of the
main driver to generate plot for part (c).

Please COMMENT OUT part(d) in main driver before you finish that step.
Otherwise, you won't be able to run the program because of errors.

Note:
1. You must finish the first two parts (math part) of this problem before
   attempting the coding part.

2. Please read the instructions and hints carefully, and use the name of the
variables we provided, otherwise, the function may not work.

3. Placeholder values are given for the variables needed, they need to be
   replaced with your own code

3. Remember to comment out the TODO comment after you finish each part.

	# =============part c: Plot data and the optimal linear fit=================
	# NOTE: to finish this part, you need to finish the part(a) of this part
	# 		first

	# load the four data points of tihs problem
	X = np.array([0, 2, 3, 4])
	y = np.array([1, 3, 6, 8])

	# generate 100 points along the line of optimal linear fit.
	# HINT:
	#	1) Use np.linspace to get the x-coordinate of 100 points
	#	2) Calculate the y-coordinate of those 100 points with the m_opt and
	#	   b_opt, remember y = mx+b.
	#	3) Use a.reshape(-1,1), where a is a np.array, to reshape the array
	#	   to appropraite shape for generating plot

	# variables to start with
	mu, sigma, sampleSize = 0, 1, 100

	# parameters
	# loc : float or array_like of floats Mean (“centre”) of the distribution.

	#		100 new points generated above

	#	1) Use np.ones_like to create a column of 1
	#	2) Use np.hstack to stack column of ones on X_space to create
	#	   X_space_stacked
	#	3) Use np.linalg.solve to solve W_opt following the normal equation:
	#	   X.T * X * W_opt = X.T * y

	#		obtained
	# HINT:
	#	1) Use X_space for x-coordinates (same)
	#	2) y = mx + b
	#	3) Make sure the array is in appropraite shape using a.reshape(-1,1)
